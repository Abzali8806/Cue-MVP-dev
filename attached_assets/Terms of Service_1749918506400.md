## Agreement to Terms

Welcome to Cue ("Company," "we," "our," or "us"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our platform that transforms natural language workflow descriptions into deployable AWS Lambda code (the "Service"), operated by Cue.

By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, then you may not access the Service. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

## Description of Service

Cue is a comprehensive platform designed to democratize workflow automation by converting natural language descriptions into production-ready Python code optimized for AWS Lambda deployment. Our Service provides an innovative solution that bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation.

### Core Functionality

Our platform accepts natural language descriptions of workflows and business processes, processes these descriptions using advanced natural language processing and artificial intelligence algorithms, generates syntactically correct and optimized Python code suitable for AWS Lambda deployment, provides a node-based user interface for credential management and code customization, validates generated code for quality, security, and best practices compliance, and delivers comprehensive deployment instructions and guidance.

The Service is designed to serve users with varying levels of technical expertise, from business analysts and product managers to experienced developers seeking to accelerate their workflow automation projects.

### Platform Features

Our platform includes intelligent tool identification and integration recommendations, comprehensive code validation and security scanning, interactive node-based interface for workflow visualization and credential management, customizable code templates optimized for different use cases, detailed deployment guides tailored to specific AWS configurations, and ongoing support for generated code and deployment processes.

## User Accounts and Registration

### Account Creation

To access certain features of our Service, you must sign in using either Google OAuth or GitHub OAuth. When you authenticate through these providers, we receive basic profile information including your name, email address, and profile picture. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your authentication provider account and for all activities that occur under your account.

### Account Responsibilities

You are responsible for ensuring the security of your Google or GitHub account used for authentication. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these security obligations or from unauthorized access to your authentication provider account.

You agree to use your account only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You may not use your account to engage in any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations, infringes on the rights of others, or interferes with the proper functioning of our Service.

### Account Termination

## Acceptable Use Policy

### Permitted Uses

You may use our Service to create legitimate workflow automation solutions for business, personal, or educational purposes. You may generate code for automating data processing, integration tasks, notification systems, and other lawful business processes. You may share generated code within your organization or with clients as part of your professional services.

### Prohibited Uses

You may not use our Service to generate code for illegal activities, malicious purposes, or activities that violate the rights of others. Specifically, you may not create workflows designed to spam, harass, or harm others, access systems or data without authorization, violate intellectual property rights, distribute malware or malicious code, or engage in any form of cybercrime or unauthorized data collection.

You may not attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise derive the source code of our platform, use automated tools to access our Service in ways that exceed normal human usage patterns, interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of our Service, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or user accounts.

### Content Standards

All natural language inputs and generated content must comply with applicable laws and regulations. You are responsible for ensuring that your workflow descriptions and intended use cases are lawful and do not infringe on the rights of others. We reserve the right to review and remove content that violates these standards.
