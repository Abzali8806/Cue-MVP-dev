# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 14, 2025  
**Last Updated:** June 14, 2025

## Introduction

Welcome to Cue ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our platform that transforms natural language workflow descriptions into deployable AWS Lambda code (the "Service"). 

We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This policy describes our practices regarding data collection, use, and protection, and your rights concerning your personal data.

## Information We Collect

### Personal Information
When you create an account or use our Service, we may collect the following personal information:

**Account Information:** When you sign in using Google OAuth or GitHub OAuth, we receive basic profile information including your name, email address, and profile picture from your chosen authentication provider. We use this information to create and manage your account, authenticate your access to the Service, and communicate with you about your account. We do not store passwords as authentication is handled entirely through these trusted third-party providers.

**Profile Information:** Any additional information you choose to provide in your user profile, such as your company name, job title, or professional background. This information helps us personalize your experience and provide relevant features.

**Contact Information:** Information you provide when contacting our support team, including your name, email address, and any details about your inquiry or issue.

### Technical Information
We automatically collect certain technical information when you use our Service:

**Usage Data:** Information about how you interact with our platform, including the workflows you create, the natural language descriptions you input, the code generated, and the features you use. This data helps us understand user behavior, improve our algorithms, and enhance the Service.

**Device Information:** Details about the device you use to access our Service, including device type, operating system, browser type and version, screen resolution, and device identifiers.

**Log Data:** Server logs that include your IP address, access times, pages viewed, time spent on pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This information helps us monitor the performance and security of our Service.

**Cookies and Tracking Technologies:** We use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience, remember your preferences, and analyze usage patterns.

### Workflow and Code Data
Given the nature of our Service, we collect and process:

**Natural Language Inputs:** The workflow descriptions you provide to our platform for code generation. We process this information to understand your requirements and generate appropriate code.

**Generated Code:** The Python code our platform creates based on your inputs, including any modifications you make through our node-based interface.

**API Credentials and Configuration:** Information about third-party services you integrate with your workflows. However, we do not store your actual API keys or sensitive credentials on our servers.

**Deployment Information:** Details about your AWS Lambda deployments and configuration preferences to provide relevant guidance and support.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following purposes:

### Service Provision and Improvement
We use your information to provide, maintain, and improve our Service. This includes processing your natural language inputs to generate code, validating the generated code for quality and security, providing the node-based interface for credential management, and generating deployment instructions tailored to your specific requirements.

We continuously analyze usage patterns and user feedback to enhance our algorithms, improve code generation quality, develop new features and capabilities, and optimize the user experience across our platform.

### Communication and Support
We use your contact information to respond to your inquiries and provide customer support, send important updates about our Service, including security notifications and policy changes, provide technical assistance and troubleshooting guidance, and share relevant educational content and best practices for workflow automation.

### Security and Compliance
We process your information to monitor for suspicious activities and potential security threats, prevent fraud and unauthorized access to accounts, ensure compliance with our Terms of Service and applicable laws, and maintain the integrity and security of our platform.

### Analytics and Research
We use aggregated and anonymized data to conduct research on workflow automation trends, analyze the effectiveness of our code generation algorithms, understand user needs and preferences, and develop insights that benefit our entire user community.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following limited circumstances:

### Service Providers
We work with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our platform and providing our Service. These providers may have access to your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify.

**Cloud Infrastructure Providers:** We use secure cloud services to host our platform and store data. These providers maintain strict security standards and compliance certifications.

**Analytics Services:** We may use analytics tools to understand user behavior and improve our Service. These tools process anonymized or aggregated data whenever possible.

**Communication Services:** We use email and messaging services to communicate with users. These providers are bound by strict confidentiality agreements.

### Legal Requirements
We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal processes, such as subpoenas, court orders, or government requests. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such requests unless prohibited by law.

### Business Transfers
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. We will provide notice of such transfer and any changes to this Privacy Policy.

### Protection of Rights
We may disclose information when we believe it is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others.

## Data Security

We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your information:

### Technical Safeguards
We use industry-standard encryption to protect data in transit and at rest, maintain secure servers with regular security updates and monitoring, implement access controls to limit who can access your information, and conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

### Operational Safeguards
Our team follows strict data handling procedures and receives regular security training. We maintain incident response procedures to address any potential security breaches promptly and effectively.

### Credential Security
We take special care with API credentials and sensitive configuration data. We do not store your actual API keys or tokens on our servers. Instead, we provide secure interfaces for you to input credentials directly into your generated code, and we use temporary, encrypted storage only during the validation process.

## Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide our Service and fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy:

**Account Information:** Retained while your account is active and for a reasonable period after account closure to comply with legal obligations.

**Usage Data:** Retained for analytical purposes in aggregated or anonymized form to improve our Service.

**Generated Code and Workflows:** Retained according to your preferences and our data retention policies, with options for you to delete your data.

**Support Communications:** Retained for a reasonable period to provide ongoing support and improve our Service.

You may request deletion of your personal information at any time, subject to legal and operational requirements.
